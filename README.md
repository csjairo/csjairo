## Hi there 👋  
My name is Jairo Holanda, and I am a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in Quixadá. In addition to being a dedicated student, exploring the components that make up the vast sea of computers around the world, I have a keen interest in the Philosophy of Computer Science and the Philosophy of Technology.

## About Development 💻  
I am currently studying back-end development using Java and the Spring Framework 🌱. I am also learning front-end development with Angular and React (JavaScript). Additionally, I have an interest in Cloud Computing, such as Azure or AWS Cloud ☁️.
